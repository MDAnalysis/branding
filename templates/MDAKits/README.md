# MDAKits empty gears template

The documents in this directory are provided freely for modification and downstream use as logos or favicons for MDAKits. Please edit them as you see fit (for example, by placing your own logo inside the gears) for your own use!

The SVGs were originally created in Inkscape. Once a new logo is created, we recommend exporting rastered versions at different resolutions (for example, 300 dpi) for use online, on slides, documents, and so on.
